## Solution :

```java
public interface Person
(String getName(); String getSex(); String getAddress(); )
public class Student implements Person
{ public String getName() { //code here } public String getSex() { //code here } public getAddress() { //code here)
public class Teacher implements Person
(public String getName() { //code here) public String getSex() { //code here) public
getAddress() { //code here)}
```
### Explanation:

Option A is wrong because if Person is base class then we have to define person class that is not good way as per definition of question asked

Option B is correct because it is a correct way to create interface and implement it.

Option C is wrong because definition of methods not given in class

Option D is wrong because abstract class cannot be implemented they can be extends only
